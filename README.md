Customizable Notification System for Reddit

## Setup

### Config.xml
In the config.xml file, in between the two "Subreddits" tags
put the subreddit you wish to monitor by adding a new tag like: 
```xml
<subreddit name="your_subreddit" />
```
and filing your_subreddit in properly.

## Todo
* Write README
* Add more filters
* Fix redundant reading of config.xml
* First read from config pre for loop then process in the forloop to get the new posts
